# Predicting High School Student Performance

This project aims to predict high school students' final academic performance
(A, B or C) using machine learning models based on demographic, academic,
social and lifestyle factors.

## Dataset
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle:
- Students Performance Dataset
  
It contains 2,392 students and 14 variables.

## Objective
- Identify key factors influencing academic success
- Predict students at risk of underperformance
- Provide an interpretable and reliable prediction tool that can be used by educators

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost
- k-Nearest Neighbors
- Ensemble Model (soft voting)

## Results
- Best individual model: Logistic Regression
- Best overall performance: Ensemble Model
- Most influential feature: Absences
